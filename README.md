GitRebaseReflogFixSample

## I just ran a rebase and messed up bad. How can I un-do it and start-over?

This repo has two walk throughs. 

- [Windows.md](Windows.md) (uses powershell in some cases to make commands easy)
- [Mac.md](Mac.md) (steps build/tested wiht the (zsh) shell - your mileage may vary)

These pages describes a set of steps to create a git repository and simulate what happens if you git
rebased and got yourself into a bad state. Then an approach to un-do the bad rebase and start the rebase over.

#Enjoy!
